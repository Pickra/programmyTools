# Programmy Tools

### What is this?
This is an introduction to tools that developers use.

### Who's it for?
This is for people who have no background in programming.

### How's it different than all the other documentation?
In general, documentation is written under that assumption that the reader has some reference to what the documentation is about, and an understanding of the programming world. This can be frustrating to new users because they get lost looking up geek speak, instead of what the author intended.

When I go to learn about something new, I just want to get started. I don't want to have to [grok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) the whole thing, and I don't want to have to look up definitions for the author's geek speak.

This is written with the assumption that the reader has `absolutely no understanding` of the programming world. It's written as a walkthrough to get the reader up and running, with some basic vocab, as soon as possible. Plus, it's an easy guide to reference at any time.
