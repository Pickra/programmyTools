## Geek Speak
- `File System` 			= is how you access all your files and `directories`; like the `finder` on a mac or the search box on the Start menu in Windows.
- `Directory` 				= is a folder in your `file system`.
- `Parent`					= is the first `directory`. The `directory` that holds all the other `directories` of the group, project, or computer.
- `Child`					= is a `directory` inside of a `parent`.
- `Root` 					= is the `parent directory`. Where all of the `child directories` live on your computer.
- `Path`					= is the location you're at in the `file system`. Ex: `root`/`child`/`child`.
- `CLI` or `Command Line` 	= are commands that you use in the [terminal](../terminal/terminal.md) to maneuver through the `file system`.

## Using the `cli`
- `/` = is the `root directory`.
- `~` = is the `home directory`. The `parent directory` where <span style="color: green;">your</span> stuff lives.
- `pwd` = shows you where you are in the `file system`; what `path` you're on.
- `cd` = means change (the) `directory`. Running `cd` will move you to the `~`, no matter where you are.
- `cd nameOfChilddirectory` = `cd` into a `child directory`.
- `cd ..` = `cd` up a `directory`.
- `ls` = lists all the regular files in the `directory` you're in.
- `ls -la` = lists the hidden files + regular files, in the `directory` you're in.
