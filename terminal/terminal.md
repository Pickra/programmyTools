# Terminal

## Where is it?
- Mac
- Windows

## Geek Speak
__Directory__ = is a folder in your `file system`.
__File System__ = is how you access all your files; like the `finder` on a mac or ... in Windows.
__Root__ = Where all of the directories live.
__CLI__ or __Command Line__ = commands that you use in the `terminal` to manuever through the `file system`.

## Using the `cli`
- `/`, root directory.
- `~`, home directory. Where your stuff lives.
- `pwd`, shows you where you are in the `file system`.
- `cd nameOfChilddirectory`, moves you down into a child directory.
- `cd ..`, moves you up a directory.
- `ls`, lists all the regular files, in the directory you're in.
- `ls -la`, lists the hidden files + regular files, in the directory you're in.
